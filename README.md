This is my first ever project in C++ (and my first project ever). It's a simple text-based adventure game. I thought a generic fantasy-adventure genre would be pretty boring, so I made a life simulator. I made it as 
deterministic as possible, you spawn with basically your entire fate immediately sealed under the mercy of the rand() functions that decide your intelligence, appearance, wealth, personality traits, and your birth
location. I thought that would be pretty realistic. If you happen to have a pretty perfect set of luck, you would notice you barely have to make any decisions. It makes for a pretty boring player-experience but I
find that to be realistic, it's both a skill issue on my part and an unintentional realistic detail. If you spawn in with pretty bad luck, you would be forced into making decisions that will impact the direction
of your life rather than going with the flow the whole run. I learned a lot making this project, greatly outpacing my uni curriculum so far with stuff like void() and arrays and rand(). The deterministic and kind of
depressing theme of the whole game is a little controversial and may be met with a lot of disagreement, but I guess to each his own. Also, I felt a bunch of spice was necessary to add to this pretty technically bland
and beginner dish, as stated in the beginning with my intent of making something other than a generic boring fantasy adventure game. I cannot compete technically with super-cracked programming prodigies, let alone
artificial intelligence, so I decided to make it as spicy as possible to somewhat stand out. AI cannot be controversial. My favourite part was the marriage void function, with the if function depending on your 
appearance and wealth. I thought that was pretty funny. But yeah, hopefully I make great progress and make better, cooler projects in the future. See you soon
